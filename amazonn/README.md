Home Page
The home page displays a list of featured products, along with their prices and images. Users can click on a product to view its details on the product page.

Product Page
The product page displays a list of all products available for purchase. Users can sort the products by price or popularity, or filter them by brand or color. The page also includes a search bar that users can use to search for specific products. Each product includes a picture, name, description, price, and a button to add the item to their cart.

Add to Cart Functionality
When a user clicks the "Add to Cart" button on the product page, the item is added to their cart. The cart page displays all items in the user's cart, along with their quantities and total price. Users can update the quantity of items in their cart or remove items altogether.

Filtering and Sorting
Users can filter products on the product page by brand or color using a dropdown menu. They can also sort products by price or popularity by selecting an option from a dropdown menu.

Admin Portal
